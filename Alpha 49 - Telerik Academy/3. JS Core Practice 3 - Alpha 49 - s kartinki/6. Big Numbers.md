# Big Numbers

## Description

Write a method that adds two positive integer numbers represented as arrays of digits (each array element `arr[i]` contains a digit; the last digit is kept in `arr[0]`). Write a program that reads two arrays representing positive integers and outputs their sum.

## Input

-   On the first line you will receive two numbers separated by spaces - the size of each array
-   On the second line you will receive the first array
-   On the third line you will receive the second array

## Output

-   Print the sum as an array of digits (as described)
    -   Digits should be separated by spaces

## Constraints

-   Each of the numbers that will be added could have up to `10 000` digits.
