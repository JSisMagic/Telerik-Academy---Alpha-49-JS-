### Explanation:

-   Tried using the `sort()` method?
    
-   What is the output? Why this is happening? It is not a bug in JavaScript, it is the expected behavior.
    
-   ["The default sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values."](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)
    
-   Try using the following function. `a` and `b` are the previous and next number in the array.
    
    ```
      arr.sort(function(a, b) {
        return a - b;
      });
    
    ```
