# Battle Boats

You and your best friend are so bored of writing code whole day and decide to play a game of battle boats.

After a few games played you felt bored again and since you are already a programmer geek you decide to implement it using all your skills acquired during the last couple of weeks.

**The first player to Shoot is Player 1**

# Input

-   Read from the standard input
-   On the first line, find **R** and **C**, separated by a space
    -   The size of the board of each player (they are equal)
    -   **R** rows, **C** columns
-   On the next **2*R rows**, find the numbers **1** or **0** as a value of every cell of the board of each player.
    -   The first **R** lines are for **player one's** and the **next R** lines are for **player two's** board.
-   After that you will receive a sequence of commands
    -   Each on a new line until you reach **END**
    -   The commands will be in the format **[Shoot R C]** where:
        -   **R** is the row on which you put your bomb
        -   **C** is the column on which you put your bomb
        -   **R and C** define the cell

# Output

-   Print on the standard output
    -   **Booom**
    -   **Missed**
    -   **You already shot there!**
-   On the last line you should print the result of every player (boats left undestroyed) int format **P1:P2**
