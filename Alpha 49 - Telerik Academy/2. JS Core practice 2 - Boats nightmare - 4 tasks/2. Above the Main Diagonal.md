# Above the Main Diagonal

Description of the JS task: You are given a number `N`. Using it, create a square matrix of numbers, formed by powers of 2 and find the sum of the numbers above the main diagonal, excluding the diagonal itself.

## Input

Read from the standard input.

- On the first line, read the number `N` - the number of rows and columns.

## Output

Print to the standard output.

- On a single line print the sum of the numbers above the main diagonal excluding the diagonal.

## Constraints

- `N` can get as big as 30.

## Sample tests

### Input

4

### Output

70

### Explanation

With `N` equal to 4, we will have a matrix that looks like this:

1 2 4 8
2 4 8 16
4 8 16 32
8 16 32 64


The main diagonal is 1 4 16 64, so the sum of the numbers above it: 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 70.
