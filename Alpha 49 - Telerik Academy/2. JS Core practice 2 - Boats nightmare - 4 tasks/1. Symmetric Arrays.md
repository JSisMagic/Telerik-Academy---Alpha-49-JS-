# Symmetric Arrays

You are given some arrays of numbers. Your task is to check if they are symmetric. A symmetric array is one, where the element at index `x` is equal to the element at index `array.length - 1 - x`.

## Input

Read from the standard input.

- On the first line, read the number `N` - the number of arrays to follow.
- On the `N` lines, read the elements of each array, separated by white space.

## Output

Print to the standard output.

- For each of the arrays, print `Yes` if the array is symmetric, or `No` if it's not.
